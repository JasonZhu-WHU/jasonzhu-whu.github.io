Hello! I am Jie Zhu, currently a master student in [the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/), supervised by Prof. Li Yang. Previously, I received my bachelor degree (Software Engineering) from [Computer School of Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest is mainly about AI for SE, especially on utilizing Natural Language Processing techniques to conduct intelligent software engineering researchs, such as software quality and maintenance. Besides research, I am interested in playing badminton and chess (Go). 

If you want to communicate with me, feel free to send me an email to whuzhujie@qq.com or zhujie2022@iscas.ac.cn. And my school is located in HaiDian district, Beijing. So we could have a face-to-face meeting if you like.
