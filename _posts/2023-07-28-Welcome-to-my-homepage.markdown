Hello! I am Jie Zhu, currently a master student in [the Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/), supervised by Prof. Li Yang. Previously, I received my bachelor degree (Software Engineering) from [Computer School of Wuhan University](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/). My research interest is mainly about NLP4SE(Natural Language Precessing for Software Engineering), especially on utilizing pretrained language model techniques to conduct code-related researches. 

My main research areas include:

- Pretrained Language Models and LLMs application (Check my cv for details. If you don't have it, please contact me)
- Search and Recommendation (especially for recall algorithms in recommender system, feature interaction learning, cross-domain recommendation and CTR prediction)
- Code Intelligence (**[method name recommendation](https://jasonzhu-whu.github.io/pdf/aumena_slides.pdf)**, [release notes generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.06720.pdf), and [code review automation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08014.pdf))
- User Review/Comment Analysis (for real-time issue detection: [iFeedBack](https://cloud.tencent.com/developer/article/1798426))

If you want to communicate with me, feel free to send me an email to whuzhujie@qq.com or zhujie2022@iscas.ac.cn. My wechat account is named as "whuzhujie". Also, my school is located in HaiDian district, Beijing. So we could also have a face-to-face meeting if you like.
